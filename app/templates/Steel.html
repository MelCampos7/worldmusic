<h1>Steel band music/pan music</h1>
<p>steel band, also spelled steelband, Trinidadian music ensemble, particularly associated with Carnival, that is primarily composed of steel idiophones—called pans or steel pans—made from the bottoms of 55-gallon oil barrels. The barrel bottoms are hammered inward, different areas being shaped to yield distinct pitches. When struck with rubber-tipped mallets, the instruments produce bell-like tones. A steel band typically includes pans of various pitch ranges as well as a number of nonmelodic percussion instruments.</p>
