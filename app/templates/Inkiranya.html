<p style="color: aliceblue;">Inkiranya is an influential drumming style originating in Burundi carried out by a percussion ensemble. The performance usually contains up to 30 people producing a pulsating beat organized around the inkiranya drum. In addition, there's a continuously playing amashako drum that compliments the polyrhythmic style of the inkiranya drum. </p>
