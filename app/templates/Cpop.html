<p style="color: aliceblue;">C-pop is an abbreviation for Chinese popular music (traditional Chinese: 漢語流行音樂; simplified Chinese: 汉语流行音乐; pinyin: hànyǔ liúxíng yīnyuè; Jyutping: hon3jyu5 lau4hang4 jam1ngok6), a loosely defined musical genre by artists originating from the Greater China region. This includes countries where Chinese languages are used by parts of the population, such as Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia. C-pop is used as an umbrella term covering not only Chinese pop but also R&B, ballads, Chinese rock, Chinese hip hop and Chinese ambient music, although Chinese rock diverged during the early 1990s.</p>
